# Values
This template creates two host macros that need to be customized:

- **{$NUT_SERVER}**: this needs to be the IP address/FQDN of the server running *NUT*
- **{$UPS_NAME}** (optional): this gives the name of the UPS connected to the *NUT* server. This is useful if multiple UPS devices are used
