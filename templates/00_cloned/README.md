# Introduction
This directory contains cloned versions of the built-in tempates included with any *Zabbix* installation.

These templates may have been customized (or not) and can be used to make a diff with the newer versions of the templates: this way, it is possible to make sure nothing breaks when upgrading *Zabbix* official templates to newer versions.
